public class Encapsulation {
    // Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in OOP that restricts direct access to an object's data and methods.
    // It allows for controlled access through public methods, ensuring data integrity and security.

    //Data hiding is the provess of protecting members of a class
    // from unintended changes by restricting access to them.
    // It is achieved through access modifiers (private, protected, public) and encapsulation techniques.

// Absrtaction is hiding the implementation details and showing only the useful parts of the user object.
// It is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces in Java. 
// Abstraction allows for a simplified view of complex systems, 
  // making it easier to understand and use them.
// It also promotes code reusability and flexibility 
  // by allowing different implementations of the same interface or abstract class.
